**Hi everyone**

I have created this application for **Windows** to manage all the classic **DOOM** games, as well **HERETIC** and **HEXEN** and to be able to launch the games using mods, addons and community maps in a comfortable and simple way.

This new version includes its own content explorer that allows you to download new contents easily and free from the official website with a complete selection of the best mods and addons from the DOOM community, and of course you can add your own content downloaded from internet.

The app is very easy to use and includes a complete help to learn how to use it.  

I'll hope you like it.  

Greetings and thanks.
